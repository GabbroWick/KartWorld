# KartWorld — working notes for Claude Code

Read this first. Then `KARTWORLD_GAME_DESIGN.md` (what the game is) and
`CLAUDE_CODE_MASTER_PROMPT.md` (how we work) only when a task touches design or
process. `ARCHITECTURE.md` explains the code; `README.md` is for humans.

## Status

| Phase | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — project setup | done | Godot 4.7.2, git, input map, structure |
| 1 — character | done | walk/run/jump/double jump, camera, 62 headless checks |
| 2 — island hub | done | procedural island, forest, mountain, house, NPCs, 40 checks |
| 3 — kart | **next** | summon, enter/exit, drive, turbo, jump |
| 4 — portal | todo | |
| 5 — first level | todo | objective, star, checkpoint |
| 6 — combat | todo | enemy, damage, death, respawn |
| 7 — progression | todo | |
| 8 — polish | todo | |

Open decisions for the human: renderer (Forward+ vs compatibility for Web),
final character scale. Both cheap to change today, documented in ARCHITECTURE.md.

## Loop

PLAN → IMPLEMENT → RUN → TEST → FIX → DOCUMENT → COMMIT. One phase per session,
verify before moving on, stop and report at the end of a phase.

## Commands

Godot binary (this machine): `C:\Godot\Godot_v4.7.2\Godot_v4.7.2-stable_win64_console.exe`
(`_console` prints to the terminal; the non-console exe is the same engine).

```bash
G="/c/Godot/Godot_v4.7.2/Godot_v4.7.2-stable_win64_console.exe"
$G --headless --path . res://tools/tests/test_runner.tscn          # movement suite
$G --headless --path . res://tools/tests/test_island_runner.tscn   # island suite
$G --path . res://tools/capture_screenshot.tscn -- out.png 120     # render a frame to PNG
$G --path . --quit-after 400                                       # run the game 400 frames
$G --headless --path . --editor --quit                             # reimport / refresh class cache
$G --headless --path . --script res://tools/setup_input_map.gd     # regenerate input map
```

Run the two suites and a screenshot after every change; read the PNG. Both
suites exit non-zero on failure.

## Conventions

* Scenes in `scenes/`, scripts mirror them in `scripts/`, data in `resources/`,
  dev/test helpers in `tools/`. Placeholder art is primitives only.
* Gameplay reads actions from `InputActions`, never keys. Bindings come from
  `tools/setup_input_map.gd`.
* A character = `scenes/characters/character.tscn` + a `CharacterDefinition`
  `.tres` + a visual scene. Never special-case the leopard.
* Components, not monoliths: controller / input / motor / health / abilities.
* World props are `@tool` scripts driven by exported size/colour; forests and
  rocks are `PropScatter` rules, not hand-placed nodes.
* Tests are scenes under `tools/tests/` (autoloads are unavailable to
  `--script` main loops).
* Commit per feature with a conventional message; never rewrite history.

## Engine gotchas (cost real time already)

* `DirectionalLight3D` must stay at position (0,0,0) — a positioned one drops
  the whole scene into shadow (looks blue and flat).
* Godot front faces wind **clockwise**. Build normals with `Plane(a, b, c)`;
  CCW triangles are invisible from above and collide from below.
* In hand-written `.tscn`, export Node references as `NodePath` and resolve in
  code; a typed `@export var x: SomeNode` set as `NodePath(...)` stays null.
* Vertex-colour materials need `vertex_color_is_srgb = true` or colours wash out.
* `Input.action_press()` reaches a polling character one physics tick later.
* Hand-written `Transform3D(...)` in `.tscn` lists basis columns X, Y, Z then
  origin; prefer `rotation_degrees` for readability.

## Where things are

* Entry: `scenes/main.tscn` → `scripts/core/main.gd` spawns world + player + camera.
* Hub: `scenes/world/island_hub.tscn` (terrain, house, portal site marker,
  scatters, NPCs). Test arena: `scenes/world/test_arena.tscn`, used by
  `scenes/dev/movement_gym.tscn`.
* Characters: `scripts/characters/`, definitions in `resources/characters/`
  (leopard = player; fox, panda = NPCs), visuals in `scenes/characters/visuals/`.
* Groups: `terrain`, `player_spawn`, `portal_site`.
* Physics layers: 1 world, 2 player, 3 enemy, 4 interactable, 5 vehicle.

## Next step (Phase 3 — kart)

Separate `VehicleController` entity (not attached to the character), summon
near the player, enter/exit with `interact`, drive/turbo/jump as abilities,
camera rig re-targets to the kart. Reuse `HealthComponent` and
`AbilityComponent`. Add a `tools/tests/test_kart*` suite before calling it done.
